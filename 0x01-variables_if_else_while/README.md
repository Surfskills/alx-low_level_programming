    The output of the program is:
        The number, followed by
            if the number is greater than 0: is positive
            if the number is 0: is zero
            if the number is less than 0: is negative
        followed by a new line
        
1-last_digit.c - 
This program assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. On completing the source code(scanf function) it prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

    The variable n stores a different value every time you run this program
    The output of the program is:
        The string Last digit of, followed by
        n, followed by
        the string is, followed by
            if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
            if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
            if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
